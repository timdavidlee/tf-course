tensorflow coursework

Since I couldn't the tensorflow course I had in mind, I've decided to put the materials together myself. The materials in this repo are a compilation of the following:

- stanford cs20
- machine learning with tensorflow (shulka)
- poking around on the web
- GCP specialization on coursera
